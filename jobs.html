                application is produced for cell phones, for example,personal digital
                assistants, enterprise digital assistants or mobile phones. These
                applications can be pre-installed on phones during manufacturing
                platforms,or delivered as web applications using server-side or
                client-side processing (e.g., JavaScript) to provide an
                "application-like" experience within a Web browser.</section>

                back-end and core computational logic of a website, software or
                information system. The developer creates components and features

                <h1>Data Analyst</h1>
                Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming,
                and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information,
                informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. Data analysis
                has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques
                under a variety of names, while being used in different business,
                science, and social science domains.

                front-end and back-end portions of an application. Being a Full-Stack
                Developer doesn’t mean that you have necessarily mastered everything
                required to work with the front-end or back-end, but it means that you
                are able to work on both sides and understand what is going on when
                building an application.

                <h1>UX Designer</h1>

                user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility,
                and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product. User experience
                design encompasses traditional human–computer interaction (HCI) design,
                and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as
                perceived by users.
