    <main> Higher Levels of Languages
        As mentioned before, there are "medium" languages which are closer to the machine, and high-level languages that take care of more things automatically. Even within these high-level languages, some languages (such as Java and C#) are more optimized for the machine while other languages choose greater flexibility for the programmer.<br><br>
        Java and C#
        Java and C# are two very similar programming languages that are well-optimized and have stricter rules to help prevent programming mistakes. Code in these languages need to be “compiled” into lower-level code before it runs, and all variables need to be “declared” with their name and type. They also enforce/encourage a methodology known as “object-oriented programming”, requiring all code to belong to an “object”.<br>
        People who program in these languages use an IDE to write their software in, which can provide various features to help with programming, such as auto-completion suggestions while they code, and automatic highlighting of certain errors. The rules in these languages will help you detect certain errors before you even run your code, which can be especially helpful when learning programming. However, Java or C# are not made for writing simple scripts, and they are not as popular for quickly creating dynamic websites.<br><br>
         In summary, you should learn one of these languages if you:
        <li>Want to program for a big company</li>
        <li> Want extra rules to help prevent errors</li>
        <li> Require very fast software for large projects</li>
        You should likely do C# if you'll just be doing things on Windows, but you should do Java if you want to make Android apps or are going to a college that does Java.</main>
